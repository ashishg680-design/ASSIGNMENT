        "Q 1 What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "ans-OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It's a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects and classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Concepts in OOP:\n",
        "1. Class: A blueprint or template for creating objects. Defines properties and behaviors.\n",
        "2. Object: An instance of a class. Represents a real-world entity.\n",
        "3. Inheritance: Mechanism where a new class inherits properties and methods from an existing class.\n",
        "4. Polymorphism: Ability of methods to do different things based on the object they're acting upon.\n",
        "5. Encapsulation: Bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (class).\n",
        "6. Abstraction: Hiding implementation details and showing only necessary information\n",
        "\n",
        "Q 2 What is a class in OOP ?\n",
        "Ans- A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. Defines properties and behaviors.called class\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3  What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "Ans-object is a fundamental building block. It represents a real-world entity or concept in code, encapsulating data and behavior related to that entity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4  What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "Ans-\n",
        "Abstraction is about hiding complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is about hiding internal details and protecting data.\n",
        "example\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def __init__(self):\n",
        "        self.__engine_status = \"off\"   # Encapsulated attribute\n",

        "Q5 What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "Ans-Dunder methods allow you to customize the behavior of your objects with built-in Python syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "They enable your classes to work with:\n",
        "\n",
        "Built-in functions: len(obj) → obj.__len__()\n",

        "\n",
        "Q6 Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP ?\n",
        "Ans-Inheritance is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows you to define a new class that inherits attributes and methods from an existing class. This mechanism enables code reusability and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",

        "\n",
        "ans-\n",
        "\n",

        "Ans-ChatGPT said:\n",
        "\n",
        "A constructor in Python is a special method used to initialize objects when a class is created.\n",
        "It allows you to assign initial values to object attributes automatically.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans-A class method is a method that works with the class itself, rather than with instances (objects).\n",
        "It can access or modify class variables, but not instance variables\n",
        "\n",
        "eg-@classmethod\n",
        "def method_name(cls, ...):\n",
        "\n",
        "while in static method A static method does not depend on either the class (cls) or the object (self).\n",
        "It behaves like a normal function but is kept inside a class for logical grouping.\n",

        "Q11 What is method overloading in Python ?\n",
        "Ans-Method overloading means defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (number or type).\n",
        "It allows a class to perform different actions based on the arguments passed to a method.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12  What is method overriding in OOP ?\n",
        "Ans-Method overriding occurs when a child class (subclass) defines a method that already exists in its parent class (superclass), but with a different implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "It allows a subclass to modify or extend the behavior of a method inherited from the parent class\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13  What is a property decorator in Python ?\n",
        "Ans-The @property decorator in Python is used to create getters, setters, and deleters for class attributes — in a clean and Pythonic way, without calling explicit methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "It allows you to access methods like attributes, making your code more readable and encapsulated.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14  Why is polymorphism important in OOP ?\n",
        "Ans -Polymorphism — meaning “many forms” — is one of the four core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), along with encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "It allows the same interface or method to behave differently depending on the object that calls it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15 What is an abstract class in Python ?\n",
        "Ans - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly — it serves as a blueprint for other classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is used when you want to define a common interface (set of methods) that all subclasses must implement.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16  What are the advantages of OOP ?\n",
        "Ans- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on objects and classes, which brings several advantages over procedural programming.\n",
        "✅ 1. Modularity\n",
        "✅ 2. Reusability\n",
        "✅ 3. Encapsulation\n",
        "✅ 4. Polymorphism\n",
        "✅ 5. Abstraction\n",

        "Q17 What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable ?\n",
        "Ans-\n",
        "Class variables → same for all objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instance variables → different for each object.\n",
        "\n",

        "print(s1.grade)  # A+\n",
        "print(s2.grade)  # B\n",
        "\n",
        "Q18  What is multiple inheritance in Python ?\n",
        "Ans - Multiple inheritance in Python means that a class can inherit from more than one parent class.\n",
        "In other words, a child (derived) class can access the attributes and methods of multiple base classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "example-\n",
        "class Parent1:\n",
        "    # code for parent 1\n",

        "    # code for child class\n",
        " Q19  Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python ?\n",
        " Ans- In Python, both __str__ and __repr__ are special methods (also called dunder methods, short for “double underscore”) used to define string representations of objects — but they serve different purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s the breakdown 👇\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 1. __str__ (User-friendly string)\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: To return a readable, human-friendly string representation of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Used when you call print() or str() on an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "It’s meant to be informative for the end user.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 2. __repr__ (Developer-friendly string)\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: To return an unambiguous, detailed string representation of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Used in the Python shell or when you call repr() on an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "It’s meant to be useful for debugging and developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ideally, it should return a string that could be used to recreate the object\n",
        "\n",
        "Q20 What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python ?\n",
        "Ans-The super() function in Python is used to call a method from the parent (or superclass) inside a child (or subclass).\n",
        "\n",
        "It helps ensure that the parent class is properly initialized or its methods are executed without having to explicitly name the parent class.\n",
        "example\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        super().speak()   # Call Animal’s speak()\n",
        "        print(\"Dog barks\")\n",
        "\n",
        "d = Dog()\n",
        "d.speak()\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q21 What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-The __del__ method in Python is a destructor — a special method that is called automatically when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e., when it is no longer needed and its memory is being freed by the garbage collector).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example\n",
        "class FileHandler:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, filename):\n",
        "        self.file = open(filename, 'w')\n",
        "        print(\"File opened.\")\n",

        "    def __del__(self):\n",
        "        self.file.close()\n",
        "        print(\"File closed automatically when object deleted.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Create object\n",

        "\n",
        "# Delete object manually\n",
        "del f\n",
        "\n",
        "Q22  What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python ?\n",
        "Ans-\n",
        "1. @staticmethod\n",
        "\n",
        "Does not take any reference to the class or instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "It behaves like a regular function inside a class — grouped logically but doesn’t depend on the class or its objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Can be called using class name or object.\n",
        "@staticmethod\n",
        "def method_name():\n",
        "    # code\n",
        " 2. @classmethod\n",
        "\n",
        "Takes a reference to the class itself as the first argument (usually named cls).\n",
        "\n",
        "It can access or modify class variables, and is shared by all instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "Can also be called using class name or object.\n",
        "\n",
        "@classmethod\n",
        "def method_name(cls):\n",
        "    # code\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q23  How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance ?\n",
        "Ans-Polymorphism in Python with inheritance means that a child class can define its own version of a method that also exists in the parent class, and Python will automatically call the appropriate version depending on the object that is used.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q24 What is method chaining in Python OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans-Method chaining in Python OOP is a technique where multiple methods are called sequentially on the same object in a single line, with each method returning the object itself (self).\n",
        "\n",
        "It allows you to write clean, concise, and readable code by linking method calls together — like a chain.\n",

        "\n",
        "Q25  What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-The __call__ method in Python allows an object to be called like a function.\n",
        "\n",
        "In other words, if a class defines the __call__() method, then its instances can be invoked using parentheses () — just like a regular function call.\n",
